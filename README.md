Snak
====

A sort of Snake-inspired game where you use genetic algorithms and/or neural
nets to train critters to pursue and avoid things.

Assets
------

While I'm sketching this I'm using placeholder art mostly from
<http://opengameart.org>. Until I settle on final assets or replace them I'm
keeping the assets in a separate local folder to avoid redistributing somebody
else's work without attribution.
