Snak
====

A sort of Snake-inspired game where you use genetic algorithms and/or neural
nets to train critters to pursue and avoid things.

Assets
------

While I'm sketching this I'm using placeholder art mostly from
<http://opengameart.org>. If you feel I'm using an asset that you created
inappropriately, please tell me and I'll fix the problem. But for now I'm using
a couple of simple free graphics in a prototype and not for profit.
